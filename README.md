A sleek, privacy-first personal website built to demo user journeys using [Umami Analytics](https://umami.is/). Features built-in dark/light mode toggle, tracked user interactions, and a showcase of my work in data science, science communication, and design-driven research.

  - About
  - Projects (+ tracked links)

3. Push to your `gh-pages` branch or main branch for GitHub Pages hosting.
